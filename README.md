# NaNoGenMo_fairytale

This code was created to generate a "novel" called "Once Within a Time". The novel is created by generating a Markov chain out of the text of "Grimm's Fairytales" and lyrics from "Reality Surf" by Bladee. The structure consists of 777 (actually 778 when including chapter zero) chapters consisting of 7 sentences each. This is obviously intended to reference the number of infinite compeltion in Hebrew gematria, which relates to why the chapters are called "epochs". An epoch is defined as "a period of time in history or a person's life, typically one marked by notable events or particular characteristics." What this structure is meant to do is to highlight the relationship between defined intervals of time relative to a self-contained infinity. The short fairytales are small stories that create worlds and narratives that begin and end with themselves, but exist effectively forever because they can be revisited. The entirety of this piece is meant to talk about narrative in the context of time and the lack of time in infinity.
